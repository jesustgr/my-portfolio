## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://jesustgr.github.io/my-portfolio/)

This is a portfolio page, which I can add to as the course progresses. While completing this project, I applied the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

The website includes a header with my full name along with links to quickly navigate through the page. In what I like to call the meat of the site, near the top is my headshot next to a description that gives a snapshot of who I am. Below that are eventually going to be a catalog of my created applications. On the right-hand side of the page is a contact section with images representing each way to contact me.

The site also has an adaptive layout that will optimize itself based on the screen being used to view it.


## Usage 

- The links in the top right corner can be clicked on to navigate through the separate sections of the site.
- So far, I only have one real project to post to my portfolio (Horiseon), so this is going to be the only image that fades in and out when you hover over it as well as lead you to a deployed page upon clicking on it.
- All the logos on the right and side under "Contact Me" are links that can be clicked on to open the specified means of communication. (I did not link my actual Twitter and Instagram just yet, but the GitHub link takes you straight to my profile, and the Email link takes you to your default mail app and prefills my email as the recipient)
